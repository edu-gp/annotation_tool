# TL;DR Version
## Step one: Modify the models
Make changes in the `db/model.py` file. All models are currently saved there.

## Step two: Auto-generate the migration script
`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "YOUR_DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_CHANGE"`

## Step three: execute the migration
### Uprade
`alembic upgrade head`. This will update the table to the latest version.

### Downgrade
`alembic downgrade base`. Warning: this will downgrade the table to nothing!

### Choose a specific version
`alembic history` will show all the versions. Pick your favorite and replace
 `head` or `base` with it.

## Note
The autogenerated script has its limitations. For example, the autogenerated
drop command does not work for sqlite. Check the `test_adding_a_fake_field
.py` in the `versions` folder for reference.
